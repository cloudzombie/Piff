# Piff
Client side based application that connects users, who live in states that 
have passed legislation legalizing recreational and/or medical cannabis, with 
thier prefered strains and the legally liscensed retail outlets carrying that
strain. 

When the user arrives at the web page, the current location is centered on the
map and strain searches can be made by typing text into the text box and then 
clicking the leaf button.

The search location is limited to 25 mile radius around the user's geoloaction. 
This is a direct limitiation of the API powering the queries. The number of returned 
hits for dispensaries carrying a specific strain is limited  by the API to 10. 

To change the search location, empty the input field and type in your address and
click the globe button.
